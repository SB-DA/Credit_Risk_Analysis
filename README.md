> # Credit Risk Analysis
Modeling and evaluating credit risk using Machine Learning models built in Python.

> ## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service company, we oversampled the data using **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms, and undersampled the data using **ClusterCentroids**. Our next approach involved using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm to combine over- and under-sampling. To predict credit risk, we compared two new machine learning models, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**. Based on these results, we evaluated the performance of the models and made a written recommendation about whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
